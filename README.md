**ALLaVA-Caption-LAION-4V* and *ALLaVA-Instruct-LAION-4V* share the same set of images.

***ALLaVA-Caption-VFLAN-4V* and *ALLaVA-Instruct-VFLAN-4V* share the same set of images. 

***In *ALLaVA-Caption-VFLAN-4V* and *ALLaVA-Instruct-VFLAN-4V*, we additionally include 30K samples which are distilled following the same manner for LAION (i.e. Distilling Captions and Complex Reasoning QA pairs). We mix them up with the other data whose instructions are from the original VFLAN.


### Data Preparation

#### LAION

Specify the `laion_root` in `./download/download_laion.sh` and run 
```shell
sh ./download/download_laion.sh
```
<!-- Specify the input and output paths in `./download/laion/download_laion.sh` and simply run
```shell
sh ./download/laion/laion.sh
```
to start downloading images from URLs in the annotation files. As a reference, downloading 512K images takes ~10 hours with 200 threads and a maximum bandwidth of 3MB/s. The outputs of running this script are:

- successfully downloaded images (binary files)

- captions in conversation format with local image paths (json)

- instructions in conversation format with local image paths (json) -->


#### VFLAN
Specify the `vflan_root` in `./download/download_vflan.sh` and run 
```shell
sh ./download/download_vflan.sh
```


#### Evol-Instruct-GPT4-Turbo-143K
Specify the `text_root` in `./download/download_text.sh` and run 
```shell
sh ./download/download_text.sh
```

The leaf design is split into two symmetrical halves, separated by a gap that runs along the ring's band. Each half of the leaf pattern is textured with detailed, vein-like striations that give it a realistic look. The edges of the leaf design are embellished with small, clear gemstones that could possibly be diamonds, adding a sparkle to the ring. The band of the ring is wide, supporting the large leaf motif, and it tapers slightly as it moves away from the leaf design. The silver metal has a high polish, reflecting light brightly and providing a contrast to the textured leaf surface. The craftsmanship suggests a mix of organic inspiration with a touch of elegance due to the gems
tone accents."

It has a long, narrow neck with tuning pegs at the top, resembling a stylized \"T\" shape. The body of the guitar is irregular, with two cutaways on either side of the neck, giving it an asymmetric appearance. The body is also characterized by sharp angles rather than curves, which is not typical for most guitars. There are four horizontal lines across the body, likely representing strings. The drawing is black and white, with no shading or color, and appears to be hand-drawn with a single continuous line without much detail. The background is plain and white."

The small, clear gemstones catch the light, creating a sparkling effect that contrasts with the silver's polished surface and the leaf's textured details. This sparkling accent likely increases the ring's visual appeal, making it stand out more as an accessory. In terms of value, the presence of gemstones, which could be diamonds, would likely raise the ring's monetary worth. Gemstones, especially diamonds, are prized for their beauty and durability, and their addition to jewelry pieces often signifies a higher quality and class of the item, thereby increasing its market value."

The animal present in the photograph is quadrupedal, possesses a body structure similar to that of a pig, and has features such as long hair and tusks, which are characteristic of a wild boar. Additionally, there is no evidence of bipedal creatures or any human-like figures that would suggest the presence of Bigfoot. The setting and visual clues do not align with the commonly reported sightings of Bigfoot, which often describe it as a solitary figure standing upright among trees. Therefore, based on the visual information available in the image, the conclusion is that Bigfoot is not depicted here."

## üè≠ Inference

### Load from ü§ó (Recommended) 
See the [example script](allava/serve/huggingface_inference.py).

### CLI

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/ALLaVA.git
cd ALLaVA
pip install -r requirements.txt

python allava/serve/cli.py --model_dir /path/to/allava/model
```

<!-- ### Setup

* Clone the directory and install basic requirements
```shell
```

* [Install Flash Attention (with a cuda device)](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-features)



### CLI -->


<!-- ### Batch Inference -->
You can use the `bot.chat()` API in `allava/serve/cli.py`  to perform generation. Don't forget to call `bot.clear_history()` after generation for each item in a dataset. An example code snippet is shown below:

```python
bot = Chatbot(config)
data = [item1, item2]
responses = []
for line in data:
    text = line['text'] # str
    image = line['image'] # either PIL.Image.Image or path to a LOCAL image

    response = bot.chat(text=text, images=image)

    responses.append(response)

    bot.clear_history() # start fresh for a new item
```



## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

### Data
<div align=center>
<img src="assets/training_datasets_by_stage.jpg" width = "640" alt="training_datasets" align=center />
</div>

As shown in the table, ALLaVA-3B uses 1M and 1.5M data for PT. and FT., respectively. 
ALLaVA-3B-Longer trains one more epoch (i.e. 3M in total) for the FT. stage.

### Code
The training code is largely based on [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). 
We wholeheartedly express our gratitude for their invaluable contributions to open-sourcing LVLMs.

### Cost
We train our models on 8*A800 GPUs.
[ALLaVA-3B](https://huggingface.co/FreedomIntelligence/ALLaVA-3B) takes 8.3h for PT and 10.6h for FT.
[ALLaVA-3B-Longer](https://huggingface.co/FreedomIntelligence/ALLaVA-3B-Longer) takes 8.3h for PT and 21.3h for FT.
These two models share the same PT procedure.


### Hyperparameters

| Global Batch Size| ZeRO Stage| Optimizer | Max LR| Min LR | Scheduler | Max length | Weight decay |
| ---: | ---: |--:| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 256 (PT) / 128 (FT) | 1| AdamW | 2e-5 | 2e-6 | CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts | 2048 | 0 |

The LM backbone, projector are trainable, while the vision encoder is kept frozen. 
**The trainabilities of each module are the same for both stages.**
